# SoniFightConfigs

Game configuration files for the SoniFight application.

While SoniFight ( https://github.com/FedUni/SoniFight ) comes with a number of configs, this repository can be used to add or modify configs between software releases.

Please feel free to submit any configs you've created here for inclusion in the next SoniFight release.
